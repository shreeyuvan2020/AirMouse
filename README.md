# GyroMouse
Is it a mouse? Is it a TV remote? No, it's GyroMouse! Gyromouse might look like a remote at first site, but as soon as you plug it into your computer with a USB-C cable, it is bound to no mouse pad nor any keyboard.

- 4 Cherry MX Switches
- 1 Red Keycap
- 3 White Keycaps
- 1 IMU Module
- 1 Orpheus Pico
- 2 Pin Headers
- Wires(IDK the amount)
- 1 Top Cover(top_cover.stl)

How to use:
