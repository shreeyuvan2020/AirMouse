# AirMouse
Is it a mouse? Is it a TV remote? No, it's AirMouse! Airmouse might look like a remote at first site, but as soon as you plug it into your computer with a USB-C cable, it is bound to no mouse pad nor any keyboard. 
### BOM:
- 4 Cherry MX Switches
- 1 Red Keycap
- 3 White Keycaps
- 1 IMU Module
- 1 Orpheus Pico
- 2 Pin Headers
- Wires(IDK the amount)
- 1 Top Cover(top_cover.stl)
- 1 Bottom Enclosure(bottom_enclosure.step)
### How to use:
- Hold it with your left hand so that 4 of your fingers are over the keys. 
- Plug it in via USB - C to the computer you want to connect it to.
- Download the adafruit_adxl34x and the USB_HID library from adafruit(you can suffer with that yourself)
- Open up mu editor and load the code.py file in and run the code via Ctrl+D
- The left most button can be used as the left button on the mouse.
- The center button as the scroll wheel.
- The last white button on the right as the right button on a mouse.
- The red button, however, is used for morse code, so you can type basically anything via that!
